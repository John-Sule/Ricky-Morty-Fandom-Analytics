RM fandom is a movie analytics non-profit that analyzes movie data to create visualizations, answer key questions
and find interesting patterns in data.

## <p align="center">Task</p> 
Perform analysis on data from the Rick and Morty API to determine how different features are related to the number
of episodes a character appears in. Expected to work primarily with the characters' endpoint for this analysis.

 ## <p align="center">Deliverables</p>
Employed the use of a Correlation matrix and Regular Expression in this analysis. Was quite an interesting task.
